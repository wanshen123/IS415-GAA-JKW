# RecycleSG - Optimizing Recycling Bin Distribution in Singapore

## 1.0 Problem & Motivation

### A Case Study on Singapore's Recycling Bin Distribution

As urbanization accelerates globally, effective waste management becomes paramount to maintain environmental sustainability and public health. Singapore, a densely populated city-state, faces significant waste management challenges. While initiatives like recycling have been implemented, optimizing the distribution of recycling bins remains crucial for maximizing participation and minimizing waste diversion. Geospatial analytics offer a powerful tool set to analyze spatial data, optimize resource allocation, and enhance waste management strategies.

Under [Singaporeâ€™s Zero Waste Masterplan](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/) and the [Singapore Green Plan](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/), Singapore aims to increase its overall recycling rate to 70 per cent by 2030. Achieving this ambitious goal necessitates a comprehensive assessment of the existing recycling infrastructure and targeted interventions to address any gaps in distribution.

## 2.0 Objective

This project aims to leverage geospatial analytics to optimize the distribution of recycling bins in Singapore, including normal blue recycle bins, incentive bins, and e-waste bins. By analyzing waste generation data, population density, and existing bin locations, we will identify spatial patterns, gaps in coverage, and opportunities for improvement. We will then recommend specific actions, such as relocating bins, increasing the density of certain bin types in high-waste areas, and implementing targeted educational campaigns. This project has the potential to significantly increase recycling rates, reduce waste collection costs, and promote sustainable waste management practices in Singapore.

### 3.0.1 Learning from the Works of Others

Based on the myriad recycling maps and scattered information available online, there lacks a centralized hub presenting comprehensive recycling details, including various categories like regular recyclables, e-waste, paper, clothes, and more. In response to Singapore's recycling initiative urging us to leverage geospatial analysis, we aim to streamline this data aggregation process, extracting valuable insights to formulate effective strategies towards achieving Singapore's zero emissions goals.

## 5.0 Approach

### 5.0.1 Data Collection:

-   Gather geospatial data on the locations of normal blue recycle bins, incentive bins, and e-waste bins from relevant government agencies or open data sources.
-   Acquire population density data for Singapore, preferably at a fine spatial resolution.
-   Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### 5.0.2 Data Preparation:

Standardize and geocode the location data of recycling bins and population density data for spatial analysis. Ensure compatibility of data formats and projections for seamless integration into GIS software.

### 5.0.3 Spatial Analysis:

#### Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Analysis:

-   Apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to analyze the spatial distribution of recycling bins and population density.
-   Generate KDE surfaces for normal blue recycle bins, incentive bins, e-waste bins, and population density to identify areas of high and low intensity.

#### Global and Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation:

-   Calculate global measures of spatial autocorrelation, such as Moran's I or Geary's C, to assess the overall spatial clustering of recycling bins and population density across Singapore.
-   Conduct Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis to identify specific hotspots (high-high clusters) and cold spots (low-low clusters) of recycling bins and population density.

### 5.0.4 Identification of Hotspots and Cold Spots:

-   Analyze KDE surfaces and spatial autocorrelation measures to identify hotspots and cold spots of recycling bins and population density.
-   Hotspots represent areas with high concentrations of recycling bins or population density, while cold spots indicate areas with low concentrations.

### 5.0.5 Integration and Interpretation:

-   Integrate findings from KDE analysis and spatial autocorrelation measures to identify priority areas for intervention.
-   Interpret results in conjunction with demographic data to understand the underlying factors influencing the spatial distribution of recycling bins and population density.

### 5.0.6 Recommendations:

-   Based on the analysis, develop recommendations for optimizing the distribution of recycling bins in Singapore.
-   Prioritize the allocation of resources and infrastructure development efforts in identified hotspots to enhance waste management efficiency and promote recycling behavior.
