# RecycleSG - Optimizing Recycling Bin Distribution in Singapore

## 1.0 Problem & Motivation

### A Case Study on Singapore's Recycling Bin Distribution

As urbanization accelerates globally, effective waste management becomes paramount to maintain environmental sustainability and public health. Singapore, a densely populated city-state, faces significant waste management challenges. While initiatives like recycling have been implemented, optimizing the distribution of recycling bins remains crucial for maximizing participation and minimizing waste diversion. Geospatial analytics offer a powerful tool set to analyze spatial data, optimize resource allocation, and enhance waste management strategies.

Under [Singaporeâ€™s Zero Waste Masterplan](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/) and the [Singapore Green Plan](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/), Singapore aims to increase its overall recycling rate to 70 per cent by 2030. Achieving this ambitious goal necessitates a comprehensive assessment of the existing recycling infrastructure and targeted interventions to address any gaps in distribution.

## 2.0 Objective

Our project aims to develop a comprehensive application that leverages geospatial analytics to optimize the distribution of recycling bins across Singapore. By analyzing data on population density and existing bin locations, the application will identify spatial patterns, gaps in coverage, and opportunities for improvement in the placement of normal blue recycling bins, incentive bins, and e-waste bins. The application will then provide insights based on the analysis and allow users to interactively explore the data and results.

### 3.0.1 Learning from the Works of Others

Based on the myriad recycling maps and scattered information available online, there lacks a centralized hub presenting comprehensive recycling details, including various categories like regular recyclables, e-waste, paper, clothes, and more. In response to Singapore's recycling initiative urging us to leverage geospatial analysis, we aim to streamline this data aggregation process, extracting valuable insights to formulate effective strategies towards achieving Singapore's zero emissions goals.

## 5.0 Approach

### 5.0.1 Spatial Analysis Module:

The Spatial Analysis Module will employ Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to analyze the spatial distribution of recycling bins and population density across Singapore. KDE is a commonly used technique in spatial analysis to estimate the density of point events over a continuous surface. By applying KDE to the location data of recycling bins and population density, we will generate density surfaces that visualize the intensity of these features across the city-state.

This module will involve the following steps:

-   Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing of the location data of recycling bins and population density to ensure consistency and accuracy.
-   KDE Analysis: Applying KDE algorithms to the prepared data sets to generate density surfaces for recycling bins and population density.
-   Visualization: Visualizing the KDE surfaces using interactive maps to allow users to explore the spatial distribution patterns.

### 5.0.2 Hotspot Identification Module:

The Hotspot Identification Module will utilize global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation to identify hotspots and cold spots of recycling bins and population density. Global measures, such as Moran's I or Geary's C, will provide an overall assessment of spatial clustering, while local measures, such as Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), will identify specific hotspots and cold spots within the city-state.

This module will involve the following steps:

-   Calculation of Global Measures: Computing global measures of spatial autocorrelation to assess the overall clustering patterns of recycling bins and population density.
-   Local Indicators Analysis: Conducting LISA analysis to identify statistically significant clusters of high and low values (hotspots and cold spots) of recycling bins and population density.
-   Interpretation: Interpreting the results of the hotspot analysis in conjunction with demographic and environmental data to understand the underlying factors influencing the spatial distribution patterns.

## 6.0 R Shiny Application

The shiny application will integrate the outputs from the Spatial Analysis Module and Hotspot Identification Module to provide users with interactive visualizations and actionable insights. Users will be able to explore the KDE surfaces, identify hotspots and cold spots, and access recommendations for optimizing recycling bin distribution in Singapore. The application will feature intuitive user interfaces and interactive maps to facilitate data exploration and decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers.
