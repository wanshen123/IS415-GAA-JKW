# Welcome to our Geospatial Analytics Project Homepage!

## About Us

Our project focuses on leveraging geospatial analytics to optimize recycling bin placement and management in Singapore urban areas. By analysing spatial data, we aim to identify optimal locations for recycling bins, improve waste management efficiency, and promote sustainability. Our project is a collaboration between Jin Yuan and Wan Shen, two students from the IS415 Geospatial Analytics course at Singapore Management University.
