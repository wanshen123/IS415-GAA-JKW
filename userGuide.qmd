# Home

The section provides a summary of the project's motivation and outlines the various types of geospatial analytic techniques employed in our Shiny App.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The Exploratory Data Analysis page features an interactive map showcasing the distribution of recycling bins across Singapore. Users can filter the data by the type of recycling bin (Blue Bin, E-Waste Bin, Incentive Bin and All) and visualize it alongside Singapore's population density. Additionally, users have the option to switch between different map display types such as CartoDB, OpenStreetMap, and Esri.
